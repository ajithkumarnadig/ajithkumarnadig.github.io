Namaste,

In the labyrinth of life, the realm of software development came into my life quite unexpectedly, like a movie scene. My initiation into this world was driven by the allure of money it offers, yet it was the intoxicating thrill of building that anchored me here.

A disciple of computer science, my journey into the intricate web of software technology commenced in the year 2017. Navigating through the diverse stack of technology, I found myself handling modest team early in my career.

Presently, I am busy in the art of tinkering and crafting software, driven by the sheer excitement of building, failing and getting up again to build.

Hailing from a humble background in the heart of South India, my worldview is deeply rooted in realism. My humble beginnings have sculpted the essence of who I am today, maintaining boundless hope with a sense of grounded reality.

In my pass time I capture pixels observing the world around me.

Despite not being fit, I find solace in the challenges of trekking, a pursuit that tests the mettle of both mind and body.

From succinct tweets to insightful blogs and immersive books. I read anything to everything.

Reading, for me, is a sanctuary that allows my mind to rest while simultaneously broadening my horizons, compelling me to acknowledge the vastness of our collective ignorance and fostering humility within.

Fueled by a love for exploration, I take on journeys riding my Himalayan whenever time permits.

For a glimpse into my thoughts and daily escapades, I invite you to roam around the pages of blogs section. Until then, may the pixels of existence continue to weave their tales around us.
